If you would like to get to know more about my work, here are some past projects:
- [**SharedGL**](https://github.com/dmaivel/sharedgl): An OpenGL implementation that streams over a shared memory buffer or over a network, enabling 3D acceleration in QEMU and over LAN.
- [**glBLAS**](https://github.com/dmaivel/glBLAS): A software library containing BLAS functions written in OpenGL fragment shaders.
- [**vscc**](https://github.com/dmaivel/vscc): A x86-64 compiler backend. Generates pure assembly from a custom intermediate language in a speedy manner. Comparable to a light-weight LLVM? *(maybe not quite there yet)*
- [**pyvscc**](https://github.com/dmaivel/pyvscc): A python compiler, using *vscc* to compile python code to pure assembly.
- [**cugrad**](https://github.com/dmaivel/cugrad): An automatic differentiation library written in C++ and CUDA. All kernels are written from scratch.
- [**cml**](https://github.com/dmaivel/cml): An old project exploring deep feed forward neural networks.
