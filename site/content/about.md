If you would like to get to know more about my work, here are some past projects:
- [**SharedGL**](https://github.com/dmaivel/sharedgl): An OpenGL implementation, allowing for 3D acceleration for Windows and Linux guests in QEMU through shared memory or over a network.
- [**vscc**](https://github.com/dmaivel/vscc): A x86-64 compiler backend, built with no third party dependencies. Includes an intermediate language and its own code generation.
- [**glBLAS**](https://github.com/dmaivel/glBLAS): A software library containing BLAS functions written in OpenGL fragment shaders, challenging the performance of cuBLAS.
- [**pyvscc**](https://github.com/dmaivel/pyvscc): A python compiler, proof of concept frontend for *vscc*, allowing python to be compiled into x86 assembly.
- [**cugrad**](https://github.com/dmaivel/cugrad): An automatic differentiation library written in C++ and CUDA. All kernels are written from scratch.
- [**cml**](https://github.com/dmaivel/cml): An old project exploring deep feed forward neural networks.
