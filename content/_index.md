### notable projects
* [SharedGL](https://github.com/dmaivel/sharedgl): an OpenGL implementation, enabling 3D acceleration for Windows and Linux guests in QEMU via shared memory or over a network.
* [covirt](https://github.com/dmaivel/covirt): an x86-64 code virtualizer, protecting binaries via virtualization-based obfuscation, translating native instructions into a custom VM architecture.
* [vscc](https://github.com/dmaivel/vscc): an x86-64 JIT compiler backend, built with no third party dependencies. includes an intermediate language and its own code generation.
* [ntoseye](https://github.com/dmaivel/ntoseye): windows kernel debugger for Linux hosts running Windows under KVM/QEMU. mimics the syntax/output of WinDbg.
* [glBLAS](https://github.com/dmaivel/glBLAS): a software library containing BLAS functions written in OpenGL fragment shaders, challenging the performance of cuBLAS **_(on old GPUs)_**.
* [cugrad](https://github.com/dmaivel/cugrad): an automatic differentiation library written in C++ and CUDA, all kernels written from scratch.
